# Overview of CoffeeScript

## Overview
- It is syntactic sugar for javascript
- CoffeeScript compiles into javascript
- The goal of CoffeeScript is to expose the good parts of java script while hiding the negatives
- Always keep in mind "It’s just JavaScript.”
- Syntax was inspired by Python and Ruby
- Had an impact of the future of javascript

## Overview Cont
- Many factors contribute to it being easier and faster to write; like optional braces and parentheses
- In CoffeeScript everything is treated as an expression
- Adds some functionally that is not in JavaScript
- CoffeeScript is open-source and all the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/)

# Historical development
## Time Line

- December 2009: Jeremy Ashkenas stared to develop coffeeScript
- January 4 2010: First Major release of coffee script
    - Features: Splats. Splice literals. Object comprehensions
- January 25 2010: Major release 
    - Function symbol is now ->
    - Parameters must be surrounded by parentheses

## Time Line Cont
- 20 February 2010
    - coffeeScript compiler now written in coffeeScript
- June 2010: Major release
    - loop keyword added
- Small release's with minimal changes for the next few years
- September 17th 2017: coffeeScript 2 released
    - Support for ES2015 output including async/await, classes, exporting and many more

## Early Days

- Initial compiler was written in ruby but was later written in pure coffeescript
- CoffeeScript was first announced on hacker news
- Now it is maintained by Geoffrey Booth
- One of the first compile to javascript langues


# Primitive Operations

## Variables and Assignment
- Variables do not have types, and there is no keyword to declare them.
```python
x = 6
logan = "logan"
console.log logan
```
- Compiles to this in JavaScript
```javascript
// Generated by CoffeeScript 2.5.1
(function() {
  var logan, x;
  x = 6;
  logan = "logan";
  console.log(logan);
}).call(this);
```

## Math operations
- All the math operators are preserved from Javascript

| Operator | Name           |
|----------|----------------|
| ```+```  | Addition       |
| ```--``` | Decrement      |
| ```/```  | Division       |
| ```++``` | Increment      |
| ```%```  | Modulus        |
| ```*```  | Multiplication |
| ```-```  | subtraction    |


# Data Types

## Strings
Strings are high level and are similar to Strings in python and JavaScript 
Example:
```javascript
x = "This is a String!"
```
- CoffeeScript also supports string interpolation

Example:
```javascript
x = 1234
coolString = "the value of x is #{x}"
console.log coolString
```
Output:
```bash
the value of x is 1234
```
## Objects


# Sequence Control

## If Statements
- If Statements do not use parentheses and indentation DOES matter
- Your block of code must all have the same indentation
- Logical operators are "and" and "or"

Example:
```python
hasCar = false 
canDrive = true
if hasCar and canDrive
    coolness++
    driveToSchool()
else 
    coolness--
    walkToSchool()
```

## If Statements cont
- Unless statement works the same as if except the boolean expression
```javascript
unless hasCar
        console.log "does NOT have a car =("
```

## Functions
- Functions are declared using a -> 
- Function body is determined by indentation
- The last line that is executed in the function is the return value
- Default params can be denoted by the equal sign in the parameter list

Syntax:
```javascript
funcName = (param1, param2) ->
    statements
```

## Functions Cont

Example:
```javascript
add = (a, b, c=0)->
    console.log a
    a + b + c
```

Example: one line functions
```javascript
print = (x) -> console.log x
```

## Functions Cont
- Calling functions is done by typing the name of the function followed by the parameters 
- Parentheses outlining the parameters are optional

Example: 
```python
x = add 5, 6 
x = add(5, 6)   # this is the same as the first one
x = add 5, 6 , 7  # overriding the default value 
```


## Splats
- Splats allow to unpack or pack lists or objects
- Syntax is ```varName...```

Example:
```python
printFavCourses = (first, second, others...) ->
    console.log """
        my favorite course is #{first}
        my second favorite is #{second}
        all the others are #{others.join ", "}
        """
top = ["cs1", "cs2", "cs3"]
others = ["math1", "eng2"]
allclasses = [top..., others... ] # unpack the arrays into a larger array
printFavCourses allclasses... # unpack the hole array
```

## Loops
- For loop

Basic range loop
```python
for x in [1..10]
    console.log "the value is #{x}"
```

For loop over an array with the optional access to the index 
```python
for x,i in allclasses
    console.log "index: #{i} value: #{x}"
```

## Loops Cont
- if only one function is to be executed over all the items in a list you can use the single line syntax

Example:
```python
takeClass = (x) -> console.log "i am taking #{x}"

takeClass c for c in allclasses
```

# Programming Environment

## Installation

- CoffeeScript is an npm package
- Node Package Manager or npm is a package manager for nodejs
- can be installed with the following command (assuming you have npm)
```bash
npm install --global coffeescript
```

## Runtime Environments
- Run CoffeeScript in the browser by transcompiling it into javascript and then using that javascript in the browser.
- Run the compiled javascript with nodejs
- Simply use ```coffee fileName.coffee```


# Syntax

## Syntax /  Grammar
- Grammar Rules are available (https://coffeescript.org/annotated-source/grammar.html)
- Lexer is available (https://coffeescript.org/annotated-source/lexer.htmll)
- Syntax tree is available (https://coffeescript.org/annotated-source/nodes.html)

# Evaluation

## Positives
- Exposes many good aspects of JavaScript
- Simpler to declare functions
- Can be easier to debug in some cases
- Removes double equals (==) logical operator
- Flexibility

## Negatives
- Many ways to do the same thing
- Not typed
- Outdated
- Many features of CoffeeScript have been adapted into javaScript
- Flexibility
